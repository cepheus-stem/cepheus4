But the Jovian moons’ gravitational acceleration is around 10 times less than the Earth’s and that will affect human health (less bone density) and other health conditions. Then, we considered Venus. Although Venus has potential (almost similar mass to the Earth), the temperature and atmospheric pressure are too high. The average temperature on Venus is 460°C and the atmospheric pressure is 900 times denser than the Earth’s meaning the body will implode if put there. We then considered the Gliese 667 C triple star system located 27 light years away from the Earth. It has exoplanets in the habitable zone. There may be 6 exoplanets 3-4 of which may be super-Earths found in the habitable zone. The possible planets in the star system are GJ 667 CC, GJ 667 CE, GJ 667 CF, and GJ 667 CD. It would take at least 26,847 years to cover 25 light-years so it is not possible or realistic with the urgency to leave the Earth and find a place to live on. Then, we considered Kepler 22b. But it was even more unrealistic because it was 600 light years away from it. Even if we could create a special rocket that can travel at the speed of light, the rocket would take 600 years to reach Kepler 22b. It was an Earth-like ocean planet but it wasn’t realistic. Finally, we considered Mars. Mars was near to us. It only takes 7-9 months to get there. We also set a few SMART goals for the assessment.</td>

                    <td>We continued our work from Week 5 which is doing further research on Mars, what conditions make it unlivable, and how we can modify it to meet our living requirements. First, we thought of many good ideas on how to modify Mars' conditions such as extracting Carbon from CO2 and leaving O2 in the Martian atmosphere since it's made up of 95% CO2, creating biodomes, and changing the soil to an earthly soil. And then we finally came down to two ideas. One was to genetically modify humans instead to be fit to Martian conditions or create underground houses to be protected from solar radiation, cold temperatures, and sandstorms. But then we combined those two ideas. First, we will build the underground bases, and then as the humans get settled in Mars underground, we will change Mars into a livable place by modifying the atmosphere, creating an artificial magnetic field to protect us from radiation, increase the atmospheric pressure, and be able to chemically create water or bring water from Europa due to its abundance of under ice water. At the same time, we will also genetically alter offspring so that they can get used to the new environment since we can't completely make Mars like Earth.</td>

We planned on sending 8 parts of the rocket and then connecting them piece by piece precisely. Then the spaceship will be thrust by straight-line propulsion and orbital maneuvers from the Earth to the Moon. We also made the exterior of the spaceship functional. The glasses cover a big portion of the exterior. The glasses are not ordinary but are functional glasses. They let people see through but also absorb solar energy from the Sun and transform it into electricity to power everything inside the spaceship. The thrusters are coin-shaped and glide in different directions individually to alter the spaceship’s direction. This will be important in case a rock object comes in the way considering that Mars is next to the Asteroid belt.</td>

First, we don’t have the resources and capacity. Second, we can’t cater to every human and make sure the Martian environment is suitable for them. So we made a change to the plan. The changed plan was to make the mission of removing humans from Earth to Mars, gradual than one-time. First, we will start small. We will transport people who will help in making a suitable environment on Mars. We will go underground and then go deeper and make more underground houses. The underground is customized enough (Enough oxygen is let in, water is transported from Europa, make sure electricity is running using nuclear power, food is grown, and others). Then, we will start transporting common people with no relevant importance of building a base on Mars.</td>

Aadrit has been a good team member since he joined. He has been slightly confused about the teamwork dynamics but Daniel and Aaditya helped him get used to it.
