                            <p class="overview1">This is due to the fact that they are extremely  propellant efficient and provide a high thrust(NASA 2024). This also consumes less fuel which allows us to reduce the weight of the rocket(Office of Nuclear Energy 2021).

                            <p class="overview1">Since we have no constraints in terms of money and manpower it is theoretically possible for the rockets to be built in 5 years(National Air and Space Museum 2013).

                            Also the rocket carrying the robots will be sent out first. This one will prepare the Martian soil in Korolov Crator along with executing basic base building requirements in preparation for humans. The next two rockets which will be sent are going to be sent together. This will allow for basic communication to be established along with humans being able to eaaily land on Mars.
