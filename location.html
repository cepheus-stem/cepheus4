                    <p class="overview1">
                        To decide the best planet for human settlement, we established a set of criteria to guide our
                        decision-making process. Then we utilized the criteria and carefully considered and evaluated
                        each planet after making a list of potential planets and narrowed down the options to the most
                        viable and realistic choice.
                        After finding the planet that is easiest and most convenient to settle on, we chose a specific
                        location on the planet, by creating a set of criteria and picking top places after doing research
                        and carefully narrowed down to one location of that planet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="overview"><span><strong>Criteria for Planet Selection:</strong><span></p>
                    <p class="overview1">
                        Proximity to Earth: The planet should be close enough to Earth to allow travel within a
                        reasonable timeframe and distance. (We considered using cryosleep for longer distances but
                        there are no real-life experiments that confirm it).<br>
                        Similar Environmental Conditions: The planet’s conditions must be somewhat similar to Earth’s,
                        including day length, gravity, axial tilt, size, and others.<br>
                        Availability of Water: The planet should have H2O in the form of solid, liquid or gas so that
                        settlers can purify it through processes and utilise it.<br>
                        Potential for Habitability: The planet should have a realistic potential for being terraformed or
                        modified for human life. For example, when looking for oxygen in another planet, if there is not
                        any pure oxygen, then there at least should be molecules containing O2 in the atmosphere so
                        that the O2 can be extracted through chemical processes for humans to breathe. In short, there
                        must be a potential or availability of requirements that make the planet liveable.<br>
                        Radiation Protection: The planet should offer natural features (electromagnetic field) that can
                        protect against harmful solar and cosmic radiation.<br>
                        Habitable Zone and Temperature Range: The planet should be in the habitable zone, or the
                        “Goldilocks Zone” and its surface temperature should be around 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15
                        degrees Celsius).<br>
                        Energy Sources: The planet should have natural energy sources such as solar, geothermal, or
                        wind energy to power human activities.<br>
                        Access to Natural Resources: The planet should have natural resources, such as metals,
                        minerals, and other materials necessary for construction and technological advancement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="overview"><span><strong>Evaluation of Planets Using The Criteria:</strong></span></p>
                    <p class="overview1">
                        <strong>Venus:</strong><br>
                        Positive: Similar size and mass.<br>
                        Negative: Extremely high surface temperature (around 460 °C or 800 °F) and an
                        atmospheric pressure 900 times greater than Earth’s.<br>
                        Solutions: We can use orbital mirrors to cool down Venus’ surface by reflecting sunlight
                        away but cooling down will take a lot of time, greater than a realistic timeframe of
                        escaping Earth. Another solution could be to bombard Venus’ atmosphere with
                        hydrogen resulting in graphite and water. (Universe Today, n.d). The latter then would fall
                        to the surface and cover around 80% of the surface in oceans. This requires a
                        tremendous amount of hydrogen that can be extracted from one of the gas giants, either
                        Jupiter or Saturn as around 3/4th of their atmospheric composition is hydrogen and the
                        rest, mainly helium and other minor gases. However, this process would take too much
                        time for a mission that has a limited time to escape Earth. Moreover, this has not been
                        done before and it requires lots of energy to do so. And the likelihood of damage to the
                        gas giant mining platforms is very high. So while there are solutions to the negatives of
                        Venus, they are unimplementable with the constraints of the decided “Escape Earth”
                        narrative.<br><br>
                        <strong>Europa:</strong><br>
                        Positive: Presence of water under the icy crusts, potential of subsurface oceans.<br>
                        Negative: Extremely low gravity (~10 x less than Earth’s), leading to severe health issues
                        such as reduced bone density and muscle atrophy.<br>
                        Solution: Rotational Habitats that generate artificial gravity through centrifugal force that
                        simulates gravity might be a solution. However, maintaining the rotation and stability of
                        these rotational habitats would require a continuous energy supply from Europa.
                        Generating energy from the movements of water can be a good source but research on
                        elevation (water needs to fall from a higher elevation to get enough energy. The greater
                        the height, the greater the gravitational potential energy that will be converted to kinetic
                        than electricity. Moreover, the gravitational acceleration is around 10x smaller than
                        Earth’s meaning that the height needs to be high for that to happen) have not been done
                        yet. Furthermore, living in a rotating habitat can cause disorientation and sickness of
                        motion in astronauts. There are also long-term psychological and physiological effects
                        in an artificial gravity environment that need to be studied and addressed.<br><br>
                        <strong>Gliese 667 C System:</strong><br>
                        Positive: Multiple habitable planets are found in the habitable zone.<br>
                        Negative: Extremely distant from Earth, (27 light-years or 27*9.46 trillion =
                        255439722759682 km), making travel impossible considering that current technology
                        does not have fast space crafts. The fastest aircraft ever made is X-43 A, a hypersonic
                        aircraft that travels with a speed of 11,854 km/h. That will take approximately
                        21548820884 years to reach. This is to show that it takes a significant amount of time to
                        reach there.<br>
                        Solution: One solution can be making the fastest spacecraft (which still takes a very long
                        time to reach) and putting the astronauts to cryosleep for extended by freezing them.
                        While the idea of replicating hibernation on humans is a good idea, insufficient research
                        on cellular damage, reawakening process, long-term physiological effects, and even
                        ensuring whether the person died by then or not makes it hard to rely on cryosleep as
                        legitimate currently.<br><br>
                        <strong>Kepler 22b:</strong><br>
                        Positive: Earth-like Ocean planet located in the habitable zone.<br>
                        Negative: Extreme distance from Earth, with about 640 light years. Impossible to reach
                        with current technologies. So we cannot go there any time soon.<br>
                        Solution and Gaps: Cyrosleep is not yet known as possible or impossible so we can’t
                        rely on it yet as described for the previous planet.<br><br>
                        <strong>Mars:</strong><br>
                        Positives: Signs of past water and icy sheets in the north and south poles of Mars have
                        been detected and is the closest planet next to Venus. Moreover, 95 percent of Mars’
                        atmosphere is carbon dioxide which can be used as breathable air after the oxygen is
                        extracted. Mars is the second closest planet to us and is reachable for humans to travel and settle.<br>
                        Negatives: Thin atmosphere, extremely cold temperatures, high radiation levels, dust
                        storms, soil toxicity, reduced gravity, and lack of liquid water.<br>
                        Solution: For the harsh conditions on Mars, we propose building an underground base
                        protected from the external harsh conditions and making it liveable and comfortable
                        inside. Mars’ proximity to us makes this endeavor much easier and more manageable
                        to make it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="overview"><span><strong>Chosen Planet: Mars</strong></span></p>
                    <p class="overview1">
                        After weighing the challenges posed by each planet, providing solutions for them, and
                        providing counterarguments against them,
                        After conducting an in-depth assessment of the challenges and constraints that come
                        with each planet, and proposing mitigating strategies and counterarguments, we found
                        Mars to stand out as the most feasible and realistic option for human settlement based
                        on our criteria. While Mars already presents significant life-threatening challenges, the
                        proximity, potential for resources, and manageable conditions make it the best planet to
                        go to compared to others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="overview"><span><strong>We chose Mars, but where specifically?</strong></span></p>
                    <p class="overview1">
                        After selecting Mars as the best option for human settlement, the next step is to find the best
                        specific location on Mars. To do so, we established a set of criteria to guide the decision-making
                        process and narrowed it down after thorough research and judgment just like the planet-choosing process.
                    </p>

                    <p class="overview1">
                        Natural Protection: The location should provide natural protection from intense sandstorms and
                        radiation coming from the Sun through its protective topography and other geographical
                        features.<br>
                        Resource Availability: The location should provide local resources that can be utilized to make
                        parts of the base (the above parts since most of the base is designed to be underground).<br>
                        Water Source: The location should have a water source in the form of underground water, water
                        ice reserves, or any form.<br>
                        Clear Space of Land: The location should have a clear space of land to build the base and
                        operate certain tasks without disruptions.

                        dune field of Olympia Undae, which surrounds part of the north polar ice cap. The crater floor
                        lies two kilometers beneath its rim and is covered in a 1.8-kilometer central mound of water ice
                        all year round. This deposit has a glacier with the volume of 2200 cubic kilometers of non-polar
                        ice on Mars. (Mars Express mission, 2019)

                        location of Mars. The Korolev has a bowl-shaped depression, with steep walls standing up to 2
                        kilometers that offer some protection from the harsh Martian conditions such as sandstorms,
                        Martian winds, and cosmic radiation. The Korolev Crater also has a giant deep water ice
                        reservoir that is approximately 82 kilometers across and 2 kilometers deep. This is greater than
                        the area of Canberra (814.2 km²) while the area of the Korolev Crater is approximately, 5281
                        km².

                        After the astronauts arrive, they will settle on an already prepared base by robots sent in
                        advance and expand on making it on the blue X mark spot where there is clear land. The
                        astronauts will utilize already prepared food and water from an already running system
                        connected to the ice craters.
